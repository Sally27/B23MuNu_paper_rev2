Dear reviewers,

we have read your remarks and here is out response.

We do not imply any of the two answers.

We added FSR diagram to the Figure 1.

We have changed the formulation to suggested "The only theoretical calculation available is based
 on vector-boson dominance and predicts ..."

Sally: what did we decide here? I think we should keep our grounds, but if not I can remove it from the conclusion.

My proposed answer: We believe that as it is formulated now, this measurement will trigger disucssion of more theoretical input even if we mention the publication in the conclusion.

We are not assigning weight to only a photon pole, so we believe that this reformulation would mislead the reader. However we changed "For systematic checks, a phase space model is used" -> "For systematic checks, a flat phase space model is used"

We added to the Figure 3 : "A systematic uncertainty on the signal shape due to the choice of the signal model is not shown, as it is too small to be visible."

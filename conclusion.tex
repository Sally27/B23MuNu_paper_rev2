\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

A search has been performed for the rare leptonic decay \Bmumumu, using
4.7\invfb of proton-proton collision data collected by the \lhcb experiment.
No signal is observed for the \Bmumumu decay and an upper limit of 
$1.6\times 10^{-8}$ at 95\%~confidence level is set on the branching
fraction, where the lowest of the two $\mumu$ mass combinations is below
$980$\mevcc. Under the assumption that the decay is dominated by
intermediate vector mesons, the limit for the full kinematic region stays
the same.
% The limit on the branching fraction is different to a recent
% theoretical calculation based on the vector-dominance
% model~\cite{Danilina:2018uzr}.
